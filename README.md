### Hi there, I'm RenÃ© ðŸ‘‹

I'm an open minded developer. I focus on the backend but don't shy away from working on the frontend of things. I love working with Kotlin and Rust. I'm a huge fan of getting the most out of a language's type system, building APIs that help you use them in the right way. DRY, KISS and clean code are very close to my heart.

I'm a big advocate of descriptive naming, TDD, short-lived feature branches and CI/CD. I think development teams should own every aspect of their app, from planning and development to testing, deployment and monitoring.
